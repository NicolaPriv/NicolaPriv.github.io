I am an Italian musician and researcher based in Reykjavik, Iceland. My background is in jazz improvisation, electronic music and linguistics. 

In my practice I like to embrace many different disciplines, with a focus on interactive technologies and AI as applied to music.

Currently I'm a researcher at the [Intelligent Instruments Lab] (https://iil.is/) where I am exploring through artistic practice how artificial intelligence is shaping our culture and social interactions.
