Stacco is an instrument designed to perform with Neural Audio Synthesis (NAS), developed at the Intelligent Instruments Lab (IIL) together with Giacomo Lepri.

Stacco features four magnetic attractors placed under a board, combining permanent magnets and a three-axis magnetometer. The attractors are capable of detecting three-dimensional variations in the surrounding magnetic field. Stacco's four attractors combined allow the simultaneous control of up to twelve continuous parameters.
